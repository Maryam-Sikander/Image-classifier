Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg as a golden retriever.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: AlexNet:
	    Dog_01 : golden retriever
            Dog_02 : golden retriever
        ResNet:
	    Dog_01 : golden retriever
            Dog_02 : golden retriever
        VGG:
	    Dog_01 : golden retriever
            Dog_02 : golden retriever


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: all three model architectures correctly classified Cat_01.jpg and Coffee_mug_01.jpg as not being dogs. No misclassifications were observed in this case.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I have determined that both ResNet and VGG architectures performed better in classifying the four uploaded images compared to AlexNet. These architectures demonstrated higher accuracy, resulting in improved classification results.
