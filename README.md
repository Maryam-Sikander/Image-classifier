# Dog Image Classifier Project
This project is part of the Udacity and AWS AI and ML Scholarship program, aimed at improving Python skills using a pre-trained dog image classifier.

By completing this project, we aim to enhance our Python skills and gain hands-on experience with image classification using pre-trained models. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
